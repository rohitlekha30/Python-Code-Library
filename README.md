Hi,
My name is Rohit Kumar Gupta. I have overall 10+ years of rich IT application development experience in Banking and Retail domain.

Recently, i have started learning PYTHON with the idea of upskilling myself to the newer technologies.
I hope this will take my career to a completely new and brighter path.

I would really appreciate if i can get some constructive feedback on my code repository.
